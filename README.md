The Hatchlor is a [cookiecutter] template featuring the modern and extensible Python project manager [hatch] üê£.

With hatch, you no longer need to deal with files like `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile` or `environment.yml`,
just configure everything in `pyproject.toml`. Thus, hatch is a sophisticated alternative to [pipenv], [poetry], [conda], or
direct [virtualenv] usage. Just think of hatch as a tool that allows you to easily define many isolated development environments,
e.g. virtual but also docker environments, and helps you to manage them. A bit like what [tox] does for testing environments but
for all kinds of environments, e.g. testing, linting your code, buildings your docs, and whatever you want.

Check out a [vanilla Python project] created by the Hatchlor.

## ‚ú® Features

The Hatchlor integrates the following features:

* [hatch]: Python packaging, environment management and test runner,
* [hatch-vcs]: determine the package version automatically from git tags, e.g. `v0.9`,
* [hatch-pip-compile]: support for lock-files,
* [pyproject.toml]: all package, build and tool configuration in one file,
* [pytest]: full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs,
* [coverage]: tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs with pytest integration,
* [GitHub Actions]: workflows with [dependabot], [release-drafter], [labeler], build docs, test & publish to PyPI,
* [ruff]: extremely fast Python linter/formatter, which replaces [isort], [flake8], [black], etc.,
* [mypy]: optional static type checker for Python,
* [mkdocs]: a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator,
* [pre-commit]: pre-commit git hooks that make your life easier,
* [Markdown]: instead of reStructuredText, Markdown is used consistently for all text files,
* [EditorConfig]: maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers,
* [src-layout]: the actual Python package is kept under a `src` folder avoiding many common errors.

Please note additional integrations and following amendments:

* [semantic-release]: local prepare of a commit: create changelog and commit with a version tag
* [bump-my-version] and [generate-changelog]: alternative to [semantic-release]
* [gitlint]: include linting of commit messages
* [GitHub Actions]: reworked workflows - dump context, add test publishing on TestPy, switch to new PyPi mechanism

The amendments support a local development and commit process while "outsourcing" testing for different OS
and with  different Python versions to GitHub.
The local committing includes preparation of a changelog. It is based on semantic-versioning.
Commit-messages are linted to enforce commit messages according to conventional commits format as
basis for a proper and automatically generated changelog.

The template includes a `skeleton.py` with a simple function `fib` that calculates the Fibonacci numbers
as demonstration. This is tested with `tests/test_skeleton.py` to demonstrate the corresponding features
from above. As an additional tidbit, `skeleton.py` also features [Typer] to show how `fib` can be
exposed as a CLI command. These files are only for demonstration and can be safely deleted.

## üí´ Quickstart

Install the latest [cookiecutter], i.e. >= 1.4, if not installed:

```console
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Then generate your Python project with:

```console
cookiecutter https://github.com/florianwilhelm/the-hatchlor.git
```

üéâ That's  it! Now change into the created directory and check out [`README.md`] for more information.
